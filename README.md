Retail Sales Analysis Project

Project Title: Retail Sales Analysis

Goal of the Project

This project demonstrates SQL skills and techniques commonly used by data analysts to explore, clean, and analyze retail sales data.

The project involves:

Setting up a retail sales database

Performing exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Cleaning and preparing data for analysis

Answering specific business questions using SQL queries

This project is ideal for beginners looking to build a solid foundation in SQL and understand how to derive insights from sales data.

Objectives

Set up a retail sales database: Create and populate a retail sales database with the provided sales data.

Data Cleaning: Identify and remove records with missing or null values.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze the dataset to understand sales patterns and customer behavior.

Business Analysis: Use SQL to answer specific business questions and generate actionable insights.

Project Structure
1. Database Setup
-- Create database
CREATE DATABASE p1_retail_db;

-- Create retail_sales table
CREATE TABLE retail_sales
(
    transactions_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    sale_date DATE,	
    sale_time TIME,
    customer_id INT,	
    gender VARCHAR(10),
    age INT,
    category VARCHAR(35),
    quantity INT,
    price_per_unit FLOAT,	
    cogs FLOAT,
    total_sale FLOAT
);

2. Data Exploration & Cleaning
-- Total records
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM retail_sales;

-- Unique customers
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) FROM retail_sales;

-- Unique product categories
SELECT DISTINCT category FROM retail_sales;

-- Check for null values
SELECT * FROM retail_sales
WHERE 
    sale_date IS NULL OR sale_time IS NULL OR customer_id IS NULL OR 
    gender IS NULL OR age IS NULL OR category IS NULL OR 
    quantity IS NULL OR price_per_unit IS NULL OR cogs IS NULL;

-- Delete rows with nulls
DELETE FROM retail_sales
WHERE 
    sale_date IS NULL OR sale_time IS NULL OR customer_id IS NULL OR 
    gender IS NULL OR age IS NULL OR category IS NULL OR 
    quantity IS NULL OR price_per_unit IS NULL OR cogs IS NULL;

3. Data Analysis & Findings
Q1: Retrieve all sales on '2022-11-05'
SELECT *
FROM retail_sales
WHERE sale_date = '2022-11-05';

Q2: Clothing category, quantity > 4 in Nov-2022
SELECT *
FROM retail_sales
WHERE 
    category = 'Clothing'
    AND TO_CHAR(sale_date, 'YYYY-MM') = '2022-11'
    AND quantity >= 4;

Q3: Total sales and orders by category
SELECT 
    category,
    SUM(total_sale) AS net_sale,
    COUNT(*) AS total_orders
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY category;

Q4: Average age of customers in Beauty category
SELECT ROUND(AVG(age), 2) AS avg_age
FROM retail_sales
WHERE category = 'Beauty';

Q5: Transactions with total sale > 1000
SELECT *
FROM retail_sales
WHERE total_sale > 1000;

Q6: Total transactions by gender and category
SELECT 
    category,
    gender,
    COUNT(*) AS total_trans
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY category, gender
ORDER BY category;

Q7: Average sale per month and best-selling month per year
SELECT 
    year,
    month,
    avg_sale
FROM 
(    
SELECT 
    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM sale_date) AS year,
    EXTRACT(MONTH FROM sale_date) AS month,
    AVG(total_sale) AS avg_sale,
    RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY EXTRACT(YEAR FROM sale_date) ORDER BY AVG(total_sale) DESC) AS rank
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY 1, 2
) AS t1
WHERE rank = 1;

Q8: Top 5 customers by total sales
SELECT 
    customer_id,
    SUM(total_sale) AS total_sales
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY customer_id
ORDER BY total_sales DESC
LIMIT 5;

Q9: Unique customers per category
SELECT 
    category,    
    COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS cnt_unique_cs
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY category;

Q10: Sales by shift (Morning <12, Afternoon 12â€“17, Evening >17)
WITH hourly_sale AS (
    SELECT *,
        CASE
            WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM sale_time) < 12 THEN 'Morning'
            WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM sale_time) BETWEEN 12 AND 17 THEN 'Afternoon'
            ELSE 'Evening'
        END AS shift
    FROM retail_sales
)
SELECT 
    shift,
    COUNT(*) AS total_orders    
FROM hourly_sale
GROUP BY shift;
